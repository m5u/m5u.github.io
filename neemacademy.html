                            The principal task was to understand and address the issue. Neema academy was divided into two parts Learner and Instructor. To improvise the user experience for both users, it is neccesary to understand the need of the users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I conducted user research and analysis. I started with creating user personas to represent the target audience. I interviewed students and professionals who had taken courses from Neema Academy to gain insight into their experiences and expectations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary objective of conducting user research and analysis was to gain insights into the following factors:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are the main pain points of the current solution?</li>
                            <li>How can I figure out solutions to those issues?</li>
                            <li>
                                How can I reveal what—or which parts, or features—are the most important for users?
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        Based on the research, I identified the following pain points:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The existing website was outdated and difficult to navigate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The mobile app had limited features and was not user-friendly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The course details were not well-organized, making it hard to find relevant information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is difficult for first time users to trust the platform to pay for a course.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Existing users don’t generally search on the same site for their next course.

                        <li>
                            Learner had issue in following and understanding the course.

                        <li>
                            Instructor were having difficulty in controlling the content of the course they created.

                            Wireframes: I created wireframes of the website and mobile app using Figma. I started with low-fidelity wireframes to get the basic layout and structure in place. Once the layout was finalized, I moved on to high-fidelity wireframes that included visual
                            design elements.

                            Visual Design: Using the wireframes as a guide, I created a visual design that reflected the branding of Neema Academy. I used a color palette that was consistent with their existing brand identity and created a style guide to ensure consistency throughout
                            the design.
